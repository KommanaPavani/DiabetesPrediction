# DiabetesPrediction
A Machine Learning Project for Predicting Diabetes Risk

Developed by **Kommana Pavani** as part of the **Machine Learning 100‑Hour Course** under **Think AI CEO**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a predictive model to determine the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on health parameters.
Leveraging the well-known Pima Indians dataset and machine learning techniques, it aims to facilitate early detection and promote health awareness.

---

## 🛠 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and correlation analyses.
- **Multiple Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K‑Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1‑score, ROC‑AUC.
- **Model Comparison**: Cross-validation to identify the best-performing classifier.

## 🧪 Dataset

The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database** with features including:

- Pregnancies  
- Glucose  
- BloodPressure  
- SkinThickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction  
- Age  

**Labels** indicate diabetes onset status.

## 🚧 Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KommanaPavani/DiabetesPrediction.git
cd DiabetesPrediction
````

(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📊 Usage

* **Notebooks**: Open and run the `.ipynb` files to reproduce analysis and modeling steps.
* **Trained Model**: Load saved model(s) from `models/` for inference.

---

## 📈 Results

Model performance typically includes:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1‑score
* ROC‑AUC Curve Analysis

> For example: Random Forest or XGBoost often achieves \~75–85% accuracy depending on preprocessing and tuning.

---

## 🧭 Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomSearch)
* Feature selection / dimensionality reduction
* Incorporating additional datasets or data augmentation
